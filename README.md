## Why I choose Redpine RSI9116

Recently. I'm study low power consumption module for WI-FI application, I using Texas Instruments CC3220 MCU develop my project at the beginning. Although CC3220 have great performed at power consumption and easy using platform\(have a lot  Free RTOS example in AWS\).but this MCU can't change Main clock source\(just fix at 80MHz\), It will be okay with some project, but it will be deadly problem with project using battery .At the same time I found Redpine RSI9116\(maybe recent Silicon labs acquisition it\),Have better  WI-FI power consumption than CC3220, And can connect it just thought AT command. It's the gospel for me

## Why write library by myself

Redpine have abundant example coed with WIFI host, but most of that is for sapis communicate, and Redpine library is coding base on  Free RTOS ,and in my application, just using bare metal is enough\(less code size and better power consumption \).so I decide write a library myself 

## Why Opensource 

I'm working at a smell Company in Taiwan ,I'm very new at HW and FW design, but need lead  whole project\(actually only me in the team at beginning\), you can image that how hopeless and helpless at that period

 Luckly, I met my mental Zhih-Tai, Liu\(He also have a Electro-Hedgehog in Tasker \)last year ,
